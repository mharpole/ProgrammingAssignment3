# 2 Finding the best hospital in a state
# Write a function called best that take two arguments: the 2-character abbreviated name of a state and an
# outcome name. The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and returns a character vector
# with the name of the hospital that has the best (i.e. lowest) 30-day mortality for the specified outcome
# in that state. The hospital name is the name provided in the Hospital.Name variable. The outcomes can
# be one of “heart attack”, “heart failure”, or “pneumonia”. Hospitals that do not have data on a particular
# outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings.
# Handling ties. If there is a tie for the best hospital for a given outcome, then the hospital names should
# be sorted in alphabetical order and the first hospital in that set should be chosen (i.e. if hospitals “b”, “c”,
# and “f” are tied for best, then hospital “b” should be returned).
